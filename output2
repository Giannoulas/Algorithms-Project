allocating memory
Calculating Floyd-Warshall. O(n^3) may take a few minutes
memory: current progress = 0 / 4942
memory: current progress = 1000 / 4942
memory: current progress = 2000 / 4942
memory: current progress = 3000 / 4942
memory: current progress = 4000 / 4942
The betweenness array is (bigger is better):
  1.)Node 602 is in 70832
  2.)Node 932 is in 57294
  3.)Node 3411 is in 54447
  4.)Node 2287 is in 53884
  5.)Node 3930 is in 53830
  6.)Node 1210 is in 52026
  7.)Node 4452 is in 48719
  8.)Node 2926 is in 47271
  9.)Node 2865 is in 45221
 10.)Node 1057 is in 44994
The closeness array is (total distance)(smaller is better):
  1.)Node 1678 is in 61030
  2.)Node 2944 is in 61475
  3.)Node 1377 is in 61849
  4.)Node 2781 is in 62040
  5.)Node 1365 is in 62274
  6.)Node 1368 is in 62385
  7.)Node 1380 is in 62441
  8.)Node 2685 is in 62712
  9.)Node 2795 is in 63308
 10.)Node 2782 is in 63311

allocating memory
Calculating Floyd-Warshall. O(n^3) may take a few minutes
memory: current progress = 0 / 35
The betweenness array is (bigger is better):
  1.)Node   1 is in 366
  2.)Node  33 is in 205
  3.)Node   3 is in 143
  4.)Node  34 is in 127
  5.)Node  32 is in  47
  6.)Node   6 is in  36
  7.)Node   2 is in  32
  8.)Node  28 is in  31
  9.)Node  24 is in  25
 10.)Node   9 is in  20
The closeness array is (total distance)(smaller is better):
  1.)Node   3 is in  59
  2.)Node  34 is in  61
  3.)Node  32 is in  61
  4.)Node  33 is in  64
  5.)Node   9 is in  64
  6.)Node  14 is in  65
  7.)Node  20 is in  67
  8.)Node   2 is in  68
  9.)Node   4 is in  71
 10.)Node  31 is in  72

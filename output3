allocating memory
Calculating Floyd-Warshall. O(n^3) may take a few minutes
memory: current progress = 0 / 6928
memory: current progress = 1000 / 6928
memory: current progress = 2000 / 6928
memory: current progress = 3000 / 6928
memory: current progress = 4000 / 6928
memory: current progress = 5000 / 6928
memory: current progress = 6000 / 6928
The betweenness array is (bigger is better):
  1.)Node 6927 is in 2817762
  2.)Node 186 is in 1427513
  3.)Node  10 is in 1060344
  4.)Node  86 is in 723781
  5.)Node 417 is in 704770
  6.)Node 211 is in 469125
  7.)Node   2 is in 468971
  8.)Node 249 is in 452806
  9.)Node 333 is in 449877
 10.)Node 164 is in 419365
The closeness array is (total distance)(smaller is better):
  1.)Node 164 is in 18547
  2.)Node  10 is in 18570
  3.)Node 186 is in 18789
  4.)Node 374 is in 18840
  5.)Node 436 is in 18940
